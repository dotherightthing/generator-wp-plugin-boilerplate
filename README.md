## Notes

### Testing

There aren't any tests yet, but these are on the roadmap.

PHPUnit is currently at version 6.1, but this project uses the Old Stable Release of 5.7 to work with PHP 5.6. This version is supported until February 2018, see https://phpunit.de/.

### Publishing

#### `readme.txt`

The headings correspond to the horizontal tabs that display on a plugin detail page on <http://wordpress.org/plugins>:

* Description
* Installation
* FAQ
* Screenshots
* Changelog

The remaining tabs are dynamically generated by WordPress.org:

* Stats
* Support
* Reviews
* Developers

[More about the readme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/#readme)

### Translation

`.pot` files can be generated using the [WordPress i18n tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/#wordpress-i18n-tools)
