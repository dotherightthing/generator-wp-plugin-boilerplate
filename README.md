# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

A best-practice boilerplate for plugin development.

## Installation

### A Create a folder for your plugin

1. Clone this repository to your WordPress plugins folder
1. Rename `wpdtrt-plugin-boilerplate` to `your-plugin-name`
1. Then launch Terminal from this folder

### B. Install requirements

1. Node & NPM: <https://nodejs.org/>
1. Git: <https://git-scm.com/>
1. [Bower](http://bower.io/): `$ npm install -g bower`
1. Composer: <https://getcomposer.org/download/>
1. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/): `$ sudo npm install -g yo`

### C. Set Defaults (optional)

Edit `.yo-rc.json`, to substitute in your own values.

These will then become the defaults when running the Yeoman generator (`yo`).

### D. Scaffold project

```
sudo npm link

yo wp-plugin-boilerplate
```

### Notes

#### Testing

PHPUnit is currently at version 6.1, but this project uses the Old Stable Release of 5.7 to work with PHP 5.6. This version is supported until February 2018, see https://phpunit.de/.

#### Publishing

The plugin name should not include the word 'plugin'

##### `readme.txt`

The headings correspond to the horizontal tabs that display on a plugin detail page on <http://wordpress.org/plugins>:

* Description
* Installation
* FAQ
* Screenshots
* Changelog

The remaining tabs are dynamically generated by WordPress.org:

* Stats
* Support
* Reviews
* Developers

#### Translation

`.pot` files are generated using [https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/#wordpress-i18n-tools](WordPress i18n tools)
